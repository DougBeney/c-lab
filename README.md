C-Lab
---

This is a fairly neat collection of code examples I have created to better my knowledge of the C programming language, Gtk3 and other C libraries.

## File/Directory Structure

- Makefile - Compiles and runs the current project in the `src/` directory
- c-labl-tilix-project.json - My Tilix (terminal emulator) config. Ignore if not using Tilix
- `archive/` - After I have created a cool little project in the `src/` directory, I archive it to a folder in the `archive/` directory.
